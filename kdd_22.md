## Research Track Papers

Knowledge-enhanced Black-box Attacks for Recommendations [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539359)
> Highlights: More specifically, we propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) to effectively learn attacking policies through deep reinforcement learning techniques, in which knowledge graph is seamlessly integrated into hierarchical policy networks to generate fake user profiles for performing adversarial black-box attacks.

Learning Binarized Graph Representations with Multi-faceted Quantization Reinforcement for Top-K Recommendation [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539452)
> Highlights: In this paper, we propose a novel quantization framework to learn Binarized Graph Representations for Top-K Recommendation (BiGeaR).

Debiasing The Cloze Task in Sequential Recommendation with Bidirectional Transformers [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539430)
> Highlights: In this work, we argue and prove that IPS does not extend to sequential recommendation because it fails to account for the temporal nature of the problem.

Addressing Unmeasured Confounder for Recommendation with Sensitivity Analysis [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539240)
> Highlights: This work combats the risk of unmeasured confounders in recommender systems. Towards this end, we propose Robust Deconfounder (RD) that accounts for the effect of unmeasured confounders on propensities, under the mild assumption that the effect is bounded.

PARSRec: Explainable Personalized Attention-fused Recurrent Sequential Recommendation Using Session Partial Actions [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539432)
> Highlights: This approach, while effective, is oblivious to subtle idiosyncrasies that differentiate humans from each other. Focusing on this observation, we propose an architecture that relies on common patterns as well as individual behaviors to tailor its recommendations for each person.

Towards Universal Sequence Representation Learning for Recommender Systems [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539381)
> Highlights: In order to develop effective sequential recommenders, a series of sequence representation learning (SRL) methods are proposed to model historical user behaviors.

User-Event Graph Embedding Learning for Context-Aware Recommendation [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539458)
> Highlights: However, an embedding layer with random initialization often suffers in practice from the sparsity of the contextual features, as well as the interactions between the users (or items) and context. In this paper, we propose a novel user-event graph embedding learning (UEG-EL) framework to address these two sparsity challenges.

Practical Counterfactual Policy Learning for Top-K Recommendations [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539295)
> Highlights: This work studies policy learning approaches for top-K recommendations with a large item space and points out several difficulties related to importance weight explosion, observation insufficiency, and training efficiency.

CrossCBR: Cross-view Contrastive Learning for Bundle Recommendation [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539229)
> Highlights: In this work, we propose to model the cooperative association between the two different views through cross-view contrastive learning.

Extracting Relevant Information from User’s Utterances in Conversational Search and Recommendation [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539471)
> Highlight: In this paper, we propose a model based on reinforcement learning, namely RelInCo, which takes the user’s utterances and the context of the conversation and classifies each word in the user’s utterances as belonging to the relevant or non-relevant class.

Graph-Flashback Network for Next Location Recommendation [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539383)
> Highlights: To incorporate the learned graph into sequential model, we propose a novel network Graph-Flashback for recommendation.

Aligning Dual Disentangled User Representations from Ratings and Textual Content [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539474)
> Highlights: To further improve not only the effectiveness of recommendations but also the interpretability of the representations, we propose to learn a second set of disentangled user representations from textual content and to align the two sets of representations with one another.

Towards Unified Conversational Recommender Systems Via Knowledge-Enhanced Prompt Learning [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539382)
> Highlights: However, these approaches still rely on different architectures or techniques to develop the two modules, making it difficult for effective module integration. To address this problem, we propose a unified CRS model named UniCRS based on knowledge-enhanced prompt learning.

Debiasing Learning for Membership Inference Attacks Against Recommender Systems [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539392)
> Highlights: To address the above limitations, we propose a Debiasing Learning for Membership Inference Attacks against recommender systems (DL-MIA) framework that has four main components: (i) a difference vector generator, (ii) a disentangled encoder, (iii) a weight estimator, and (iv) an attack model.

Comprehensive Fair Meta-learned Recommender System [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539269)
> Highlights: In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fair meta-learning framework, named CLOVER, for ensuring the fairness of meta-learned recommendation models.

Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer for Recommender Systems [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539473)
> Highlights: In this paper, we propose SHT, a novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments user representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an explicit way.

HICF: Hyperbolic Informative Collaborative Filtering [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539475)
> Highlights: Nonetheless, it remains unclear which kinds of items can be effectively recommended by the hyperbolic model and which cannot. To address the above concerns, we take the most basic recommendation technique, collaborative filtering, as a medium, to investigate the behaviors of hyperbolic and Euclidean recommendation models.

Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-Enhanced Transformer for Sequential Recommendation [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539342)
> Highlights: Despite their effectiveness, existing methods have far focused on item sequence representation with singular type of interactions, and thus are limited to capture dynamic heterogeneous relational structures between users and items (e.g., page view, add-to-favorite, purchase). To tackle this challenge, we design a Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-enhanced T ransformer framework (MBHT) to capture both short-term and long-term cross-type behavior dependencies.

Persia: An Open, Hybrid System Scaling Deep Learning-based Recommenders Up to 100 Trillion Parameters [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539070)
> Highlights: However, the training of such models is challenging even within industrial scale data centers. We resolve this challenge by careful co-design of both optimization algorithm and distributed system architecture.

AdaFS: Adaptive Feature Selection in Deep Recommender System [paper link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539204)
> Highlights: massive amount of information have drawn overwhelming attentions from customers, which select important features become critical. AdaFS purposes feature selection methods with hard-manner and soft-manner, which soft-manner would automatically select features while hard-manner select top-K important features. Experiments shows AdaFS has the best performance over other feature selection methods and performance improvement if adding on the existing SOTA models.
