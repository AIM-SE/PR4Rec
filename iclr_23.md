## Poster
TDR-CL: Targeted Doubly Robust Collaborative Learning for Debiased Recommendations [paper link](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=EIgLnNx_lC)
> Highlights: This paper proposes a principled approach that can effectively reduce the bias and variance simultaneously compared to existing DR estimators for debiased recommendations.

Calibration Matters: Tackling Maximization Bias in Large-scale Advertising Recommendation Systems [paper link](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=wzlWiO_WY4)
> Highlights: We solve the maximization bias problem in Large-scale Advertising Recommendation Systems.

StableDR: Stabilized Doubly Robust Learning for Recommendation on Data Missing Not at Random [paper link](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=3VO1y5N7K1H)
> Highlights: This paper proposes a theoretically guaranteed stabilized doubly robust learning approach that overcomes the shortcomings due to the presence of extremely small propensities in debiased recommendations.

ResAct: Reinforcing Long-term Engagement in Sequential Recommendation with Residual Actor [paper link](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HmPOzJQhbwg)
> Highlights: We propose a novel paradigm to reinforce long-term engagement in sequential recommendation.

Link Prediction with Non-Contrastive Learning [paper link](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=9Jaz4APHtWD)
> Highlights: We evaluate the performance of non-contrastive methods on link prediction and propose a new method to improve its performance in the inductive setting.
